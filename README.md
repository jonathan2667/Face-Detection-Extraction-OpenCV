# Face Detection and Extraction with OpenCV ðŸ‘¤

This Python script uses OpenCV to detect faces from an image and extracts them into a new image. It leverages the Haar Cascade classifier for face detection. ðŸ’»ðŸ“¸

## Features
- **Face Detection:** Utilizes the Haar Cascade classifier to detect faces from the input image.
- **Face Extraction:** Extracts detected faces and places them into a new image with a white background.
- **Efficient Layout:** Organizes extracted faces in a grid-like layout for better visualization.

## Usage
1. Ensure you have OpenCV installed (`pip install opencv-python`).
2. Replace the path to the input image (`'assets/test2.jpg'`) with your desired image path.
3. Adjust parameters like scale factor and minimum neighbors for face detection if needed.

## Credits
This script is inspired by the functionality demonstrated in the code. Special thanks to the creators for their valuable contribution!

Feel free to explore, experiment, and enhance this script further! Happy face detecting and extracting! ðŸ˜ŠðŸš€
